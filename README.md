## Description

This project simulates organizing an open office space by randomly assigning colleagues to available seats at tables. It reads a list of names from a CSV file, distributes them across a configurable number of tables and seats, then saves and displays the seating arrangement. The program demonstrates object-oriented design using classes (`Seat`, `Table`, and `OpenSpace`) and practical file handling in Python.

## Timeline
This project took approximately two days to complete.

## Usage
1. Download the project:
Clone this repository to your local computer using your preferred method (e.g., via Git).

2. Run the program:
Open your terminal, navigate to the project folder, and launch the script by typing:
```
python main.py
```
3. How it works:
The script reads the list of colleagues from new_colleagues.csv, randomly assigns each person to a seat in the open space, and then displays the final seating arrangement directly in your terminal.
A copy of the seating plan is also saved as output.csv in the main project directory.
